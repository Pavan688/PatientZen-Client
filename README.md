## Purpose and Problems it Solves:
PatientZen is an application for healthcare to schedule appointments and view, add, track patients records. This application allows patients to schedule appointments with providers. It also allows providers to document patientsâ€™ needs, providers' diagnosis, treatment, and medications. 

## Getting Started:


1. In the terminal, create a directory
```bash
cd <new directory name>
```

2. Run

git clone git@github.com:Pavan688/PatientZen-Client.git
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
4. Run the code

5. This will initialize the React app in your browser, but you won't be able to log into the site or access data without running the server side of this project. To download and start the server, go to https://github.com/Pavan688/patientzen-server and follow the README there.

6. Once you are running the server, create a new user, log in to view the site, and test out the features!
